# Vocabularies


One of the outcomes of the SWE Marine Profiles group was the semantic enhancement of SensorML with controlled vocabularies for the marine  domain [1] through the identification, formalization and publication of the required terms and their definitions as Linked Data SKOS vocabularies. The vocabularies are hosted in the NERC Vocabulary Server (NVS) and are governed by the SWE Marine Profiles via a mailing list and a wiki at https://wiki.52north.org/SensorWeb/MarineProfilesForSWE/WebHome. 

Following the NVS URL pattern,SensorML vocabularies are all grouped under the ‘W0X’ notation as shown in Table 1, although there is no semantic relevance between the vocabulary’s subject and the notation. Each vocabulary is self-documented and refers to the Marine SWE Profiles group as its creator and owner. BODC is the manager and moderator and NERC is the publisher.
